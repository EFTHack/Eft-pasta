This was quantum cheats for eft, the cheat was detected as fuck and the full assembly was dumped from the game without any obfuscation, this is a paste made by chasepaston still pasting thuglife's 2017 code.
Quantum cheats didn't even care enough about obfuscating the assembly when battleye dump mono assemblies and the string from the cheat called "QUANTUM CHEATS" is probably not the only reason their users got banned in 20 mins.
QC for eft is a detected paste as long as chase pasteson is working on it. not a fan of manhattan but he should really work on it instead of that pasting retard whom has been pasting the same sources for 4 years to fill his ego.
